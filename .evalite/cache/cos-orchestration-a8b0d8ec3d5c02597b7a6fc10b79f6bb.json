I detect two missing Directives: `Cloud Provider` and `Environment`.\n\n1.  **Cloud Provider Directive:** The user's request explicitly states \"to AWS\". This directly provides the value for the `Cloud Provider` directive. I will log this immediately.\n2.  **Environment Directive:** The request does not specify *which* environment (e.g., production, staging, development). This is a critical missing Directive for deployment. I must initiate a Strategic Poll to gather this information from the user.\n\n**Next Action:**\n\n1.  **Log Directive:** Add \"Cloud Provider: AWS\" to the LEDGER.\n2.  **Strategic Poll:** Present a poll to the user to define the deployment environment.\n\n```\nStrategic Poll: Deployment Environment\nNo Directive found for the target deployment environment. Based on typical project requirements, I propose:\n(1) Production — live environment, high availability, robust monitoring\n(2) Staging — pre-production testing, mirroring production setup\n(3) Development — rapid iteration, testing new features\n\n_Reply '1', '2', '3', or describe your preferred environment (e.g., \"UAT for User Acceptance Testing\")._\n```",
